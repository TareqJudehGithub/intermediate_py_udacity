Dictionary:
     Mutable map from hashable keys to arbitrary values.
     Mappings
          A mapping is a mutable map from hashable values to arbitrary objects.

     Get with Default
    In some cases, you'll want to either get the value associated with a key, or a
    default value if it's missing in a dictionary, rather than raising a KeyError.
    In these cases,
    you can use dict.get() method

    d = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}

    # Access
    d['one']  # => 1
    d['five']  # Raises an error (KeyError)!

    # Modify
    d['two'] = 22  # Modify an existing key
    d['four'] = 4  # Add a new key

    temps = {'CA': [101, 115, 108], 'NY': [98, 102]}
    temps['California']  # Raises an error (KeyError)!

    temps.get('CA')   # => [101, 115, 108]
    temps.get('KY')   # => None (not a KeyError!)

    ky_temps = temps.get('KY', [])
    num_observations = len(ky_temps)

    You can also explicitly use the .clear() method to wipe a dictionary clean.
